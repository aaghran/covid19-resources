                  In the past few weeks, people have been desperately turning to
                  Twitter asking for leads regarding Covid resources such as
                  oxygen cylinders, covid beds and other assistance like meals
                  for patients, academic help and ccommute.
                  <br /><br />
                  There is a lot of information present on the microblogging
                  site and sometimes it becomes difficult to filter through it,
                  as the information could be old or unverified.
                  <br /><br />
                  Here is a simple and quick tool to search for resources or leads based on a city or requirement.
